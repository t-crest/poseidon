\begin_layout Abstract
This paper shows how metaheuristics can be applied to optimize scheduling
 of of inter-processor communication in a real-time Network-on-Chip.
 This scheduling problem is an NP-complete multi-commodity flow problem,
 which we optimize using the metaheuristics Adaptive Large Neighborhood
 Search (ALNS) and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP).

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this project is to implement a scheduler for static inter-processor
 communication in a real-time Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), the
 scheduler should use metaheuristics for optimization of a greedy solution.
 In this type of Real-time system scheduling is done at compile-time to
 simplify Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis.
 In real-time systems, performance depends purely on the Worst-Case Execution
 Time (WCET) -- therefore the analyzability of the system is very important
 to obtain good performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An MPSoC is built of 
\emph on

 In a real-time MPSoC, each tile processor executes one task to keep the
 timing analysis simple and get a lower WCET bound.

\begin_layout Standard
An inter-processor communication channel is a point-to-point connection
 from one tile to another, this point-to-point connection can route packets
 along different paths.
 A path is the sequence of links, on which the packet travels to reach the
 end-point of the connection.
 Communication is statically scheduled such that communication on two channels
 can not interfere with each other -- the communication channels are decoupled.
 Decoupling is required to make the NoC-interconnect analyzable with respect
 to WCET.
 The schedule is periodic, and thus for performance reasons (bandwidth and
 latency), we optimize for the shortest possible schedule period.
 Generating the optimal routing schedule is a hard problem to solve, for
 network topologies of a certain size generating an optimal schedule becomes
 impossible on the computer systems of today.
 The scheduling problem, has multiple sources and sinks making it a multi-commod
ity flow problem.
 The nature of the problem does not allow fractional flows on edges, thus
 the multi-commodity flow problem becomes NP-complete[ref: Karp].

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal for this project is to make a scheduler that makes as good schedules
 as possible within a reasonable amount of time.
 The scheduler is meant to be usable for research purposes, thus we have
 constructed it very generic.
 Our scheduler can schedule arbitrary communication graphs on arbitrary
 interconnect topologies, the topologies are limited to routers with out
 degree 5, where one of the output ports always are connected to a CPU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is trivial to construct a greedy solution for the scheduling problem.
 To improve schedules compared to this greedy solution, we can apply metaheurist
ics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our scheduling problem is large and combinatorial in nature with both dependenci
es and constraints.
 A natural constraint is that any directed link can only transfer a single
 packet at any time-slot.
 Another constraint is that packets must arrive in the same order as they
 were sent.
 To avoid excessive feasibility-checking of the schedule due this in-order
 requirement of packets, we make the simplifying decision that all paths
 should be a shortest path.
 Due to the regularity of the graph, this shortest path routing is simple.
 Always taking the shortest path will automatically guarantee causality
 of received packets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our scheduling problem is NP-complete, thus we need metaheuristics to improve
 schedule periods from greedy algorithms.
 For most relevant network sizes it is practically impossible to search
 though the whole solution space.

To construct at good solution we expect that a greedy algorithm will give
 fairly good results, to improve the greedy solution metaheuristics can
 be used.
 A given greedy solution might not be a good target for optimization, due
 to the high density of the solution.
 A less dense solution might lead to a better solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our intuition on how a dense solution can be improved, tells us that it
 has to be spread out before it can be compressed further.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mimicking nature we think of the free links in the network as air bubbles.
 We then need to make room for the air bubbles to surface, this can be done
 by decompressing the schedule.
 To conclude, we should not only accept better solutions than our current.

\begin_layout Standard
Four different approaches to create a feasible initial solution to optimize
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Basic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(BASIC) This initial solution creates a feasible schedule by randomly picking
 channels to be scheduled onto the NoC, and then schedules them on timeslots
 one after another.
 This solution only has one channel scheduled at each timeslot, and the
 advantage using this approach, is that the schedule is not dense and thus
 the applied metaheuristic will perform all the work towards an optimal
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Deterministic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(GRREDY) The created deterministic approach is a greedy algorithm that tries
 to schedule channels onto the NoC at the earliest possible timeslot.
 The channels are scheduled in an order, where the longest channels are
 scheduled first.
 Length of channels is defined, by the number of links it has to take to
 reach its destination.
 The order, in which availability of links out of a router is checked, is
 also set.
 Due to the given attributes, this inital solution always gives the same
 result when given the same input.
 Therefore, using this initial solution, the metaheuristics are forced to
 try and optimize from the same starting point every time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Randomized-routing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(rGREEDY) This initial solution uses the same greedy approach as that of
 the deterministic, in that it tries to schedule the longest channels first,
 and the channels are scheduled at the earliest possible timeslot.
 The difference from the deterministic greedy algorithm is in how each channel
 is routed.
 Where the deterministic algorithm will always route the channels in the
 same way, the priority of possible available out links at each router is
 random, and thus if some routes can be routed better by using a different
 shortest path, this initial solution may find that route.
 Also, this gives an initial solution to the metaheuristic that is not always
 the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Randomized-routing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

order
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(RANDOM) Here, again, the channels are scheduled as early as possible, but
 now the order is random in which the channels are scheduled.
 This is another initial solution, where the starting point for the metaheuristi
c is a somewhat dense schedule, but since the routing ordering is random,
 using this initial solution will explore solutions different than those
 when deterministic or only randomized routing is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main motivation in having four different ways of obtaining initial solution
 is to explore different neighborhoods with having different starting points.

\begin_layout Standard
Our scheduling problem is to map a collection of channels to paths throughout
 time, without communication conflicts on any links at any time.
 A schedule with such conflicts is not feasible.
 The neighborhood is the search space around a current feasible solution
 when taking a small step away from it, i.e.
 incremental perturbations.
 Small perturbations of a current solution could be swapping pairs of links
 (Figure

Swapping pairs of links is always possible, but moving bends can lead to
 an infeasible schedule.
 Note that very little can be gained by swapping pairs of links -- only
 if one of the channels of Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is absent may there be a slight advantage.
 As the bend-moving example hints at, there is very limited freedom of movement
 in dense schedules.
 Hence we expect most local perturbations lead to infeasible schedules.
 Even if such small local perturbations could make room for other channels
 to be scheduled earlier, these small changes alone are unable to change
 period of the schedule.
 So instead of taking small steps, we would rather take large jumps.
 Instead of swapping of pairs or moving-bends as our primitive functions,
 we consider removing entire already-scheduled channels (
\family typewriter
rip-up
\family default
) and rebuilding (
\family typewriter
route
\family default
) them.
 Given a channel, 
\family typewriter
rip-up
\family default
 deletes the entire already-scheduled channel from the schedule.
 Given an unscheduled channel, 
\family typewriter
route
\family default
 will greedily (making randomized shortest-path routing decisions) try to
 schedule the channel as early as possible.
 
\family typewriter
route
\family default
 does this via a simple depth-first search.
 Of the paths which has just been ripped-up, the longest paths are routed
 first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach of rerouting entire channels is obviously a superset of the
 small local perturbations.
 Thus the rerouting-approach greatly increases our neighborhood and increases
 our chances of finding a new and feasible path.
 Thus our neighborhood of a current schedule is the space formed by how
 many and which channels we can reroute.
 The

 selection of which channels to reroute is the job of our operators.

\begin_layout Standard
Which element from our neighborhood to jump to next, is determined by our

 Several operators have been implemented, as this is required to make LNS
 adaptive.
 Since our primitive functions are always

, the operators are reduced to simply selecting which channels should be
 rerouted.

\begin_layout Description
Dominating

paths Recall that our main objective is minimize the schedule period.
 It is therefore natural to attack the paths which finish last, since they
 prolong the schedule.
 We call these paths for the 
\emph on
dominating paths
\emph default
.
 However simply rerouting only the dominating paths, is likely to not improve
 the period: All paths are rerouted in a greedy fashion, starting as early
 as possible.
 We therefore consider more than just the dominating paths, we would also
 like to select the paths that prevents the dominating paths from starting
 earlier.
 An approximation of those paths preventing a dominating path 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 from starting earlier, is simply the paths below 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 over all time.
 I.e.
 we select all the paths that goes through a link before 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 goes through it.
 Even through this is a gross approximation, this operator has shown to
 be the most popular in ALNS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_inset Formula $P$

 in time, we select all paths in the shortest-path rectangle containing

 This is written as a BFS search, only taking links which are on the shortest-pa

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the nature of our problem, where there is not a clear neighborhood,
 diversifying the search for solutions may be an advantage.
 Also, the problem is very large, and these properties favor the GRASP metaheuri
stic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GRASP metaheuristic consists of the phases, greedy randomized adaptive
 phase followed by a local serch phase.
 The greedy randomized adaptive phase creates an initial greedy randomized
 solution adaptively.
 After creating the initial greedy randomized solution, the solution is
 improved iteratively using a local search.
 When the solution can not be improved locally, the best solution is stored,
 if it is the best seen so far.
 These phases of creating an initial solution and performing a local search
 are then repeated for a set period of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our use of the GRASP metaheuristics is not completely in correspondence
 with its definition.
 The adaptive function that is to be used when constructing the initial
 greedy solution is not present in that phase, instead some adaptiveness
 in selecting operators when performing local search is added.
 Also, the iterative improvement in the local searchonly performs one step
 in our case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of building the initial solution randomly and adaptively, the initial
 solution is built using a cross between approaches randomized routing and
 randomized routing and order.
 This is done by constructing a sorted list of the channels from longest
 to the shortest as done in the randomized routing approach.
 A float is then passed as parameter to our GRASP, that is between 0 and
 1.
 It is normalized according to the number of channels to be scheduled.
 This number, is the number of times two channels are to be chosen in the
 sorted list and switched thereby partially ruining the sorted order of
 the channels.
 We may loop upon this float input as a variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 only, instead of being a number between 1 and number of candidates, it
 is fractional and then normalized.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 to zero will mean that the initial solution used is that of the randomized
 routing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The local search utilizes the operators dominating-{path,rectangle} and
 late-paths.
 One of these operators is chosen randomly according to a weighted random
 choice.
 After running the operator, the returned set of paths are ripped up and
 rerouted according to the same greedy appoach as the randomized routing.
 The weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w$

Contrary to GRASP, ALNS continually works on the same solution.
 ALNS repeatedly destroys a part of a solution and rebuilds it again into
 a feasible solution.
 Since we always rebuild with route, what we punish and reward are the selection
 operators described above.
 The operators fit into this scheme perfectly, so our implementation of
 ALNS is simple.
 Our ALNS implementation is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An initial solution is constructed using one of the specified algorithms
 described in Section

 is chosen stochastically.
 Each operator has an associated probability of it being chosen.
 To achieve some kind of Simulated Annealing-like behavior we give the random-se
lection operator a higher probability initially: Initial probabilities are
 33% for the random operator and 22% each for the rest, dominating-{path,rectang
le} and late-path.
 Since we have not performed any kind of extensive parameter tuning, we
 do not know how much these initial probabilities affect the solution.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The selection operator is executed, which returns a set of paths.
 This set of paths is ripped-up and re-routed again.
 As mentioned before, re-routing paths is done greedily: We first sort the
 ripped-up paths by length and route them according to this ordering.
 Any path is routed in a first-fit fashion, meaning we schedule it as early
 as possible.
 Also note that tie-breaking for shortest-path routing decisions is done
 stochastically.

 is punished or rewarded according to a simple scheme: We calculate the
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 between the period of the previous schedule and the new current schedule;
 
\begin_inset Formula $r=prev/curr$
\end_inset

.
 Thus multiplying the probability of selected operator by 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 will automatically punished or reward it.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $r>1$
\end_inset

 the current solution is shorter than the previous, so we reward by increasing
 the probability of the same operator being selected in the next iteration.
 Experimentation showed that dominating-paths was much better than random,
 so probability of random-selection drops quickly.
 To combat quick convergence we actually multiply by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{r}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Data-structure organization and delta-evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our problem domain, there are basically two ways to represent the schedule;
 time-centric or network-centric:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Time-centric We could consider grouping all routing-decisions made in the
 same timeslot, into a frame.
 The entire schedule would then consist of a layering of such frames, numbered
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $period-1$
\end_inset

.
 We would have to be able to index into a frame given a router and its link,
 asking whether any channel in this frame has been scheduled on the link.
 However the interconnection network can have holes, and could be sparse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Network-centric In reality, links are resources for which communication
 must contend.
 Thus is its more intuitive to have each link and router represented once
 only -- rather than multiple times in each frame.
 This means we localize the schedule, storing a local schedule on each link.
 In this representation, this means we do not have to go up one timeslot
 and index again to check if something has been scheduled -- this information
 is local.
 Splitting the schedule up into such localized schedules, also allows us
 to make fast successor queries.
 A drawback is that determining global schedule length now takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(n)$
\end_inset

 time where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of routers, rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

 time as in the time-centric representation.
 However using delta-evaluation this is reducible to average-case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of delta-evaluation is to reuse as much of what is known about
 the previous solution, so the evaluation function becomes quick.
 In our case, we could store a dynamically re-sizable array which for each
 index (representing a timeslot), stores how many links is scheduled in
 that timeslot.
 Whenever we mutate our schedule, the array is updated correspondingly.
 Traversing backwards from the end of the array until hitting a non-zero,
 reveals the schedule length.
 Since the period of neighboring schedules is quite close to each other,
 traversing the array will take 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

 time in the average case, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(p)$
\end_inset

 time in the worst-case.
 Finally, resizing the array dynamically takes amortized constant time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, the overall performance depends on channel-routing and very
 little on our evaluation function, which is very simple and quick enough.
 Hence we have chosen the more Object Orientation-friendly network-centric
 representation.
 If further performance improvements are sought, our 
\family typewriter
route
\family default
 primitive can be easily parallelized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calculating shortest paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of our simplifying decisions is to only route channels along shortest
 paths, as this will automatically guarantee in-order packet arrival.
 For this, we need to compute local routing decisions for the all-pair shortest
 paths.
 Since our network graph is very regular as each router only has max out-degree
 4
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For routing we only care about the 4 non-local ports of routers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and all links have unit cost, we can easily find the shortest path via
 a breadth-first search: We simply start at the destination 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and do a BFS -- as we encounter another router 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, we now know a shortest path from 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 That the path is a shortest path is guaranteed by the nature of BFS.
 Encountering 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, we simply store which port the BFS-wave reached 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 from, and associate 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 with that port in a local (perfect) hashmap, 
\begin_inset Formula $next$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $a.next[b]$
\end_inset

 returns a set of output ports of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, which lie on one of the shortest paths towards 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 Computing all these shortest-paths can be done in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$
\end_inset

 time and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$
\end_inset

 space.

The tuning was done mainly based on observations from test runs.
 During testing, we chose to focused on the mesh and bi-torus topologies
 and the scenario where each router communicates a packet of length one
 to every other router in the network.
 We focused on the mesh and bi-torus with height and width 3-10 and 15.
 Also, there was not enough time for thorough testing, so possible scenarios
 such as running a metaheuristic on very large networks for e.g.
 24 hours for getting test results to then do reruns was not an option.

 The nature of the operators dominating-{path,rectangle} and late-path implies
 that they should be given equal weight at the start of optimization.
 The adaptive function will then favor those that give good results and
 not the others.
 We have not tested other scenarios than equal weighting of the starting
 parameter in the choose table.
 The random operator though, which is only present in ALNS, we assigned
 different values.
 The reason is that it is not very likely that the random operator is going
 to increase the

We ended up setting the starting parameter for the random operator to 1.5,
 while the others are set to 1.0.

 did not seem to matter that much if it was between 0 and 0.5.
 When running for two hour, almost all the values were the same.
 As the width and heigth increased to 10 and 15 though, a

 less than 0.1 gave the best results.

Initial solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering ALNS and the initial solutions used, we do not consider
 average value of the schedule length.
 This is because as already stated, the performance of a real-time system
 is based on the worst case execution time period and thus we are most intereste
d in the initial solution giving the best solution.
 Also, the length of the initial solution and the first couple of iterations
 will be worse for the BASIC initial solution than for the others

\begin_layout Standard
Generally for the biggest networks, the GREEDY algorithm seems to be the
 best to use as an initial solution.
 This is due to fact, that as the size of the network increases, the schedule
 becomes more dense, and thus the schedule produced initially by the determinist
ic greedy algorithm is the best found schedule.

Run time

Because the program is meant for compile time optimization of a static schedule,
 the run time may exceed 24 hours.
 However for the results in this report we have used 30 min as the run time
 to get results for a variety of system sizes.

Our scheduler has been tested with custom topologies besides mesh and bi-torus,
 to verify functionality.
 For evaluating the performance of our metaheuristics we only run our scheduler
 on use-cases with all-to-all communication and on either a mesh or a bi-torus
 topology these are the only examples for which we have results to compare
 with.
 For all-to-all communication in a mesh or bi-torus topology we also have
 theoretical lower bound on the scheduling period.

 a heuristic scheduler is proposed, this scheduler has the constraint compared
 to our scheduler that the scheduler in each router must be the same.
 This constraint is made to simplify hardware.
